# SVG Logo

## Description
This application will generate an SVG file taking input from the user, being able to select a shape form a list of options, input color, text color and no more than 3 characters for logo text.
Modularity was important for this project because it helps to keep code, cleaner, ordered and easier to work with.
Object classes helped manipulating data to create more object classes inheriting properties and methods.
